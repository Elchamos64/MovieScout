# Web Pages

For now this website only has 1 page. In the future the website should have more dynamically generated pages. In the main page you can find all the functionality described above.

# Development Environment

I used a free Movie Databse API to fetch the movies information. This website was not implemeted with a framework since it's the first version. 

# Future Work

A few more project ideas to imoprove the site.
* Add a movie detail page
* Add more movie genres
* Add a log in option for user to link their accounts with saved movies.
* Add a framework or library like React and Tailwind for the css.
